*Things Removed*

* We've stopped accepting and started removing all AI tools that require paid
API keys to function.
* Removed FileCR as they've been
https://rentry.co/filecr_malware[caught with malware], and still haven't
removed it.
* Removed AnonFiles as they've decided to quit due to people
https://i.imgur.com/lXoEqAV.png[abusing the site].
* Unstarred WinRar in File Archivers. People feel its not as useful anymore
given open-source options like 7-Zip / NanaZip.
* Removed RVX from ReVanced section as its been
https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-documentation/wiki/Announcement[discontinued].
* Removed PDF Drive in PDF Sites as downloads no longer work.
* Removed TronScript in Debloaters. Some people consider it
https://i.imgur.com/K5hf5Bu.png[overkill].
* Removed Poe in AI Chatbots as its now limited to 10 daily messages (or 100 in
some countries.)
* Removed the "Everything I Know" wiki from Indexes as they've gone
https://i.imgur.com/ig8jPGL.jpg[paid]. You can get around it by blocking the
overlay, but we're not interested in sending traffic their way anymore.
* Unstarred 1337x and added https://pastebin.com/Rc9MYMZ7[warning] to avoid
software / games, as they've had issues with malware, including a torrent that
was up for days after being reported. They did remove it eventually, and
https://i.imgur.com/ij4CXIm.png[respond] to the situation, so we feel it
would be unfair to remove their site entirely. Our hope is that 1337x acts
quicker in the future, avoids situations like this, and begins to earn trust
back from people over time.

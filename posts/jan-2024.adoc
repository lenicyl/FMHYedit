Hi everyone, happy new year! As we bid farewell to '23, let's take a moment to
reflect on the remarkable journey FMHY has had this year:

* We made a new website, enriched with an array of handcrafted features (by me,
of course) to enhance your experience and make browsing the wiki pleasant on
all devices (mobile included!)
* We opened our Discord server and reached 10k members, which introduced many
new great people to this community and made contribution easy
* We've reached 250k+ members and 31 million views on reddit!
* Our FMHYedit repository oversaw an impressive 1k+ pull requests made by the
community and merged over 8k commits!
* This wiki has grown to be more than just a piracy index, so we felt it's about
time other sections get some love. As such, we organized and separated tools
sections into their own pages, which allowed us to move a lot of useful tools
out of storage and make it a lot easier to discover them
* We started the debloat arc of FMHY and went from 27k links to 24k! We've
removed a lot of dead, useless, and niche links / categories, as well as
re-organized a lot of sections for better clarity and easier navigation

As we enter 2024, we eagerly anticipate building on our achievements and
evolving together. FMHY wouldn't be what it is today without the love and
support of everyone in this community. Thank you for being an integral part of
FMHY. Here's to another year of growth and success! üíô

* Removed CryptoStorm as its https://i.imgur.com/VDlSY1T.png[possibly unsafe].
The owner has no ties to it anymore apparently, but its still hard to trust a
company with a history this dark.
* Removed our backups from NotABug. Their site goes down nearly

nightmare to keep 25 wiki pages updated there. If they ever fix their issues
we may bring it back.

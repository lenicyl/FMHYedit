=== Wiki Updates

* Our official pastebin, *https://pastes.fmhy.net/[snowbin]* is now live!
Keep in mind pastes only last for 7 days, and as of now you can't make edits,
but we may add features like this in the future.
* Ran a https://i.imgur.com/73paJlr.png[poll] regarding streaming sites, and
used the results to help us re-order the
link:/videopiracyguide[streaming section.]
* Turned Spotify into its own section w/ subsections:
link:/audiopiracyguide#spotify-clients[Clients],
link:/audiopiracyguide#spotify-adblockers[Adblockers],
link:/audiopiracyguide#spotify-download[Download] and
link:/audiopiracyguide#spotify-tools[Tools].
* Added a section for
link:/audiopiracyguide#media-soundtracks[Soundtracks] in Audio.
* Added sections for
link:/devtools#computer-science[Computer Science] and
link:/devtools#docker-tools[Docker] in Dev Tools.
* Added a section for
link:/adblockvpnguide#two-factor-authentication[Two-Factor Authentication]
in Web Privacy.
* Re-organized link:/readingpiracyguide#magazines[Magazine Sites] +
added filehosts to their descriptions.
* Removed OnStream from unsafe sites. The https://rentry.co/upo2r["evidence"]
we had listed wasn't very solid. If someone has more proof we can re-consider,
but for now we don't have reason enough to call them unsafe. Keep in mind its
not posted in the wiki, just removed from our unsafe list.
* We recently moved off Netlify, and soon after a scammer
https://i.imgur.com/rByoHnf.png[took over the domain]. If you had this page
bookmarked we'd highly recommend you remove it, and update to our
link:/[new domain]. We've tried reporting it to Netlify, but so
far they haven't done anything.
* Grammar issues have been fixed
https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/pull/1337[throughout the wiki] /
https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/pull/1340[2] /
https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit/pull/1339[3]. Remember that anyone can send
https://github.com/fmhy/FMHYedit[pull requests] to our github so don't be
afraid to help us fix things like this.
* Added a mirror of our site to https://fmhy.github.io/FMHYedit/[github.io].

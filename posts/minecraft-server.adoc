=== Things to Know

* If it times out when joining then just try rejoining again.
* If you get stuck in the lobby, use the command `/server modded` or``/server survival`` to join.
* If you can't break blocks or it's glitching, you are probably too close to the spawn and need to go farther.
* (Modded) To set a skin, use the `/skin` command.
* To hide yourself from being shown in Dynmap, run this command `/dynmap hide`.
* For modded 6GB+ RAM is required, but 12GB+ is recommended.
* Simple Voice Chat mod is supported on Modded and (optional) Vanilla servers.

Have fun! â™¥
